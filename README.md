This will be a Very Graphical network monitoring system. It will display a Graphical Image of a location and all network point to point connections and will check network transit time and dissplay the quality of all links.

Still Very Much working on this will be at Beta stage in a week or two. Just fleshing out how I think I want it to look and work right now.
